==>Emmet are basically the shortcuts for a code that we had to write in text editor this are abbrevation for code 
   that we write for eg:-table>tr*3>td>img+p+a,



● Difference between a Library and Framework?
framework
Developers need not start from scratch when they have tools to assist them like Frameworks. A framework is like the foundation upon which developers build applications for specific platforms. It includes reusable pieces of code written to perform common tasks and uses code provided by a developer for custom functionality. The framework may include defined and undefined objects and functions that developers can use to create applications. In that way, we can add significant functionality to the system by using existing code around the structure. 
Library
A library is a collection of prewritten code that can be used to simplify tasks. The term library simply refers to a collection of code that is reused repeatedly. It is essentially a set of pre-defined functions and classes that programmers can use to simplify their work and speed up the development process. So, developers do not have to write code to accomplish specific functionality because the library already includes code for those functionalities. Standard libraries are available with most programming languages, but programmers can also make their own custom libraries.



● What is CDN? Why do we use it?
==>cdn basically means content delivery network or collection of server in one location from all over the world it is a network of interconnected servers that speeds up webpage loading for data-heavy applications it is used for Reduced page load time Improved availability Increased scalability Increased security Reduced bandwidth costs

● Why is React known as React?
React was developed for applications (Facebook) that have constantly changing data. Since React is a front-end framework or the “View” in MVC, this means that as the user clicks around and changes the app’s data, the view should “react” or change with those user events. User events being mouse clicks, typing, submitting a form.

● What is crossorigin in script tag?
  ==>The crossorigin attribute sets the mode of the request to an HTTP CORS Request. Web pages often make requests to load resources on other servers. Here is where CORS comes in. A cross-origin request is a request for a resource (e.g. style sheets, iframes, images, fonts, or scripts) from another domain. 

  ● What is diference between React and ReactDOM
  ==>React library is responsible for creating views and ReactDOM library is responsible to actually render UI in the browserThe react package holds the react source for components, state, props and all the code that is react.

The react-dom package as the name implies is the glue between React and the DOM. Often, you will only use it for one single thing: mounting your application to the index.html file with ReactDOM.render().

● What is difference between react.development.js and react.production.js files via CDN?
The development build is used - as the name suggests - for development reasons. You have Source Maps, debugging and often times hot reloading ability in those builds. The production build, on the other hand, runs in production mode which means this is the code running on your client's machine.


● What is async and defer?
Async - means execute code when it is downloaded and do not block DOM construction during downloading process. Defer - means execute code after it's downloaded and browser finished DOM construction and rendering process.
